Bench optics parts list


The following is the parts list used at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre (UCL) to complete 
the bench optics exercises. Some of the more expensive parts are optional but nice to 
have. The parts list includes more parts than are needed in order to provide students 
with multiple ways of solving the same problem. Some parts listed below are re-used in
other exercises. 

Parts are from ThorLabs unless otherwise specified. Imperial part numbers are listed. 



* General optomechanics
The following are used to mount optical 

1x XT66DP-1000 optical rail 
1x 500 mm rail
4x CL5 clamps
1x XE25CL2 clamp
10x XT66C4 clamping platforms
2x packs of 5 post holders PH50-P5 (10 in total)
2x PH40 post holders
1x PH30 post holder
3x TR75 75 mm posts
7x TR50 50 mm posts
4x TR40 40 mm posts
4x TR30 30 mm posts
4x LMR2 2" lens holders (post mountable)
2x CP02 30 mm cage plate for 1" optics
2x CP02T thick 30 mm cage plate for 1" optics
1x SM1L10 1" SM1 lens tube
1x SM1L05 0.5" SM1 lens tube
1x SM1L03 0.3" SM1 lens tube
1x LCP08 60 mm Cage Plate, SM2 Threads, Enhanced Clamping, 0.5" Thick (optional)
1x LCP02 30 mm to 60 mm Cage Plate Adapter (optional)
1x SM1T2 to couple camera to cageplate
1x SM1A9 to couple camera to an SM1 tube


* Sample holders
1x DH1 filter holder
1x EDU-VS1 Post-Mountable White Polystyrene Viewing Screen (optional)
1x XYFM1 Translatable slide holder (optional)
1x SMIZ Linear translation stage for objective (optional but recommended)



* Optics
More than enough lenses are included to allow for experimentation. 
These are cheaper lenses and are to be used for the bench optics. 
In some cases either plano-convex or bi-convex are listed. Either will work.
1x LB1761 1" f=25 mm
1x LB1811 1" f=35 mm
2x LA1401 or LB1723 2" f=60 mm 
1x LA1050 or LB1630 2" f=100 mm
1x LA1979 or LB1199 2" f=200 mm
1x LA1256 or LB1917 2" f=300 mm
1x LC1715 1" f=-50 mm
1x f=300 mm SM1 for fluorescence (tube lens)

1x Olympus 4X objective (WD RMS4X) and RMS to SM1 coupler (SM1A3).



* Misc.
1x RA180
1x RA90 post clamps
2x post-mounted iris diaphragms (ID25)
2x R2 post collars (optional)
Each kit will need about 15 cap screws in each of a range of lengths from about 10 mm to 20 mm. 
Screws should be M6 or 1/4"-20 depending on your equipment.

* Cage system parts (optional)
These parts are used to make cage systems, which are mainly important for 
fluoresence imaging and building alignment jigs. For the bench optics 
exercises alone you need purchase only the ER2 rods
2x ER1.5 rods
1x ER2-P4
1x ER3-P4
1x ER4-P4
1x ER6-P4



Light sources -- TODO
LEDs (ADD THIS) 

Coverslips and a marker pen.

Slides to image. 


Electron microscopy grids of known pitch might be useful but aren't explicitly used in these exercises.
A 1 to 2 m tape measure. 

A laser pointer that fits into an RA180 post clamp that attaches to one end of a post.


* Tools
1x Lens wrench for SM1 SPW606
1x Lens wrench for SM2: SPW604
1x Hex keys such as CCHK or TC2 (TC3 for metric). 
1x BD-050 0.050" Balldriver for 4-40 Setscrews (used for cage system set screws)
1x LMR2AP alignment target (optional)
1x MFT1 1m measuring tape or a longer one (up to about 2 m) from a different supplier
1x Wera hex key set (not from Thor - optional)



* For laser alignment (beam walking) exercise
1x KM100CP Post-Centered mirror mount
2x KM100 regular mirror mounts




* General parts for 2p
2x SM1EC2B Snap-On Plastic Dust Cap for SM1 Lens Tubes, 5 Pack
