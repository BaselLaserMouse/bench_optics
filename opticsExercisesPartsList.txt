Bench optics parts list


The assumed parts list is described here, but the same exercises can be carried out with similar parts. 
Most of the following components are purchased from ThorLabs and imperial part numbers are listed.
Metric parts are also available. 
Each set up comprises the following components:


General optomechanics
1x XT66DP-1000 optical rail 
10x XT66C4 clamping platforms
4x LMR2
3x CP02
2x packs of post holders PH50-P5
1x TR30/P5
1x TR40/P5
1x TR50/P5

1x Screen or filter holder: DH1
1x Translatable slide holder XYFM1
1x Linear translation stage and cage rods for focusing: SM1Z and four ER2 posts
1x RA180
1x RA90 post clamps.


Optics
1x LED Collector lens: 1'', $f=25 mm$ LB1761 or $f=30~mm$ LA1805
2x Field Lens/Condenser Lens: 2'', $f=60 mm$ LA1401
$f=100~mm$ LA1050, $f=300 mm$ LA1256, $f=200 mm$ LA1979
$f=300~mm$ achromatic doublet (AC508-300-A). Optional.
$f=-50 mm$ LC1715

1x Olympus 4X objective (WD RMS4X) and RMS to SM1 coupler (SM1A3).



2x post-mounted iris diaphragms (ID25)
LEDs (ADD THIS) 
A 1'' SM1 tube (SM1L10) to make it easier to place the 25 mm lens near the LED.
A power source for the LED. e.g. a 5V source and $200\Omega$ resistor. 
Coverslips and a marker pen.

Slides to image. Golgi stained brain slices work well. 
Failing that, you could by a `toy' slide kit like that supplied by Celestron. 
Electron microscopy grids of known pitch might be useful but aren't explicitly used in these exercises.
A 1 to 2 m tape measure. 


Tools
1x Lens wrench for SM1 SPW606
1x Lens wrench for SM2: SPW604
1x Hex keys such as CCHK or TC2 (TC3 for metric). 
LMR2AP alignment target
4x R2 post collars


A laser pointer that fits into an RA180 post clamp that attaches to one end of a post.

A bright light source, such as a halogen lamp and light-guide. (TEST WITH LED)
