\section{Image Formation}
An image is formed when all light rays leaving one point (or region) of the object arrive at some other defined point (or region) \textit{regardless of the angle of the ray}. 
This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:imageforming}, where the grey mouse on the left is imaged through a lens to form an inverted image, i.e. the green mouse on the right. 
All light rays leaving the grey mouseâ€™s left ear converge onto the inverted image's left ear. 
When we put a sheet of paper in the image plane, we see points on the paper illuminated by rays coming from corresponding points in the object. 



\begin{figure}[h]
\center
\includegraphics{image_forming_basics.eps}
\caption{Simple image formation using one lens. 
The focal length of the thin lens is $f$, object distance is $s_o$ and image distance is $s_i$. 
The upper ray (parallel to the optical axis on the left) passes through the focal point (denoted as a dot) on the right side of the lens, the middle ray (passing through the centre of the lens) is unrefracted, and the lower ray passes through the focal point on the left side of the lens, and comes out parallel to the optical axis on the other side. 
}
\label{fig:imageforming}
\end{figure}

As the distance between the object and lens ($s_o$) is varied, the distance between the lens and image ($s_i$) also changes. This relationship is determined by the lens foca length ($f$) using the thin lens equation.

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{s_i}=\frac{1}{s_o}+\frac{1}{f}
\label{eq:thinlens}
\end{equation}

Notice that in Fig.~\ref{fig:imageforming}, the image is smaller than the object. The magnification of a lens is calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
M = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = -\frac{s_i}{s_o} = \frac{f}{f-s_o}
\label{eq:mag}
\end{equation}

The following conventions are used:
\begin{itemize}
\item $f>0$ for convex lenses
\item $f<0$ for concave lenses
\item $s_o>0$ always
\item $s_i>0$ for real images
\item $s_i<0$ for virtual images
\item Transverse distances above the optical axis are $>0$. Distance
  below are negative. 
\item $M=1$ means unitary magnification (the image is the same size as
  the object). Negative numbers indicated an inverted image.
\end{itemize}

Using a single lens to image an object is known as \textbf{finite
  conjugate} imaging because the image is paired (i.e. conjugated)
with an object at a finite distance from it. In the following series
of exercises you will use lens arrangements to image an LED.

\subsubsection{1. Determine the focal length of a convex lens }
You will use an LED as both a light source and an object to image. 
You will vary the distance between the lens and measure how far away the image of the LED is formed. 
Using equation~\ref{eq:thinlens}, you can calculate $f$. 
Do this for several values of $s_o$

\vspace{2em}

\begin{tabular}{| p{1cm} | p{1cm} | p{1cm} |}
\hline
 $s_o$  &  $s_o$  &  $s_f$  \\
\hline
\hline
 & & \\ \hline
 & & \\ \hline
 & & \\ \hline
 & & \\ \hline
 & & \\ \hline
\end{tabular}


\vspace{2em}
Draw the ray diagram (as in Fig~\ref{fig:imageforming}) for the smallest and largest values of $s_o$ that you used. 
Note how the angles on the object and image sides of the lens change.
Image a distant light source (e.g. a light on the ceiling) at what distance does the image form? Why (think about the angle of the incoming light)?


\subsubsection{2. Magnifying the image}
Calculate the values of $s_o$ and $s_i$ which produce $M=-4$ (remember, negative means inverted) for a $f=100~mm$ lens. 
Measure the size of the LED image and so calculate the size of the LED emitter. 
Verify that an image can be formed at any distance from the LED simply by varying $s_o$ and $s_i$. 


\subsubsection{3. Virtual images and infinite images}
What happens when the LED distance ($s_o$) is at $f$ from the lens?
What happens when $s_o<f$? 
So what would you need to do to still form an image on a sheet of paper?

\subsection{Combinations of lenses}
A \textbf{real image} is formed on the opposite side of the lens to the sample. 
This allows the detector to be physically separated from the sample, which is rather useful.
As a result, most optical devices use real images. 
A \textbf{virtual image} is formed on the \textit{same} side of the lens as the object. 
Both magnifying glasses and microscope eyepieces use virtual images. 


You will now learn about telescopes and beam expanders.
Beam expanders are critical for building a scanning microscope.

\subsubsection{Infinite Conjugate}
The \textbf{infinite conjugate} refers to the situation where the
object is located at a distance of $1f$ from a lens
(Fig.~\ref{infiniteConjugate}). In this scenario the rays leaving the
lens are parallel and do not converge, so this is not an image forming
condition. Instead, the image can be considered to be infinitely far
away (hence the name). If a second lens is added, then an image can
be formed. The magnification of the image is defined as
(Eq.~\ref{eq:magIC}). 
What useful feature does this arrangement have? 

\begin{equation}
M=-\frac{f_2}{f_1}
\label{eq:magIC}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]
\center
\includegraphics[width=4in]{infiniteConjugate.eps}
\caption{The infinite conjugate.}
\label{infiniteConjugate}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{A. Building the infinite conjugate}
\begin{itemize}
\item Set up two lenses with different focal lengths on the rail to build the infinite conjugate. 
Place the LED at the $f$ of the first lens and a screen at the $f$ of the second. 
\item Measure the size of the image and calculate the size of the emitter. 
\item Verify the consequences of the infinite space by moving the second lens and keeping the screen at $f$ of the second lens. 
What happens to the image size?
\item Verify Eq.~\ref{eq:magIC} by exploring what happens when lenses of different focal lengths are used. 
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{B. Building a telescope}
\begin{itemize}
\item Draw an arrow on a coverslip to use as an target to image. 
\item Use a light-guide as a light source with which to illuminate the arrow from behind. 
Use two convex lenses (60~mm and 100~mm, it's up to you which you place nearer the light source and which you place further away). 
\item Put the coverslip at a distance of 150~mm from the first lens, between the lens and the light source. 
Separate the lenses by 250~mm. 
\item Trace the ray diagram. Where will the image be formed? Is the image inverted?  Verify this experimentally. 
\item Move the lenses to alter their relative distance. In which condition is the image virtual? In
which condition real and inverted? In which condition is no image formed?
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Beam expanders}
Lenses can be used to expand the diameter of a light beam, such a laser.
Expanders can be built using either two convex lenses (Fig.~\ref{beamExpander1}) or a convex and concave lens (Fig.~\ref{beamExpander2}). 
In both cases the lenses are set up such that their focal points coincide (i.e. they are separated by the sum of their focal lengths). 
The degree to which a beam is expanded can be calculated as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d_2}{d_1}=\frac{f_2}{f_1}
\label{eq:beamExp}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]
\center
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{beamExpander1.eps}
\caption{Beam expander with two convex lenses.}
\label{beamExpander1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\center
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{beamExpander2.eps}
\caption{Beam expander with one convex and one concave lens.}
\label{beamExpander2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Aligning the lenses}
You will use a laser as a light source.
The procedure to align the laser and lenses will be explained on the board.

\subsubsection{Experimenting with beam expanders}
\begin{itemize}
\item Construct a beam expander using to convex lenses to expand the beam by at least a factor of three. 
Make sure that the two focal points coincide by checking that the exit beam is collimated
 (i.e. light rays are parallel so beam diameter is constant over long distances). 
\item Measure the size of the expanded beam and so calculate size of the unexpanded beam.
\item Swap out one of the lenses with different convex lens and verify that the expansion factor changes. 
\item What happens if the lenses are closer together or further apart than the sum of their focal lengths?
\item Construct a beam expander using a concave and convex lens. What advantages does this arrangement have?
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\subsection{Composite optical elements}
Many complex optical elements such as objectives or eyepieces (Fig~\ref{composite}) are built by combining multiple lenses in close proximity. 
In objectives and eyepieces the light doesn't pass through a focal point, as in the telescopes you built. 
The large numbers of optical elements are generally used to correct for optical abberations across the field of view. 
To experiment with composite optical arrangements  you will first construct a beam expander ($f_1$=60~mm lens and a $f_2$=300~mm). 
Light leaving the beam expander will be directed into a composite lens. 
Having the beam expanded will make it easier for you to determine the focal length of the composite elements you will build.

\begin{figure}[h]
\center
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{objectivesfigure1.eps}
\includegraphics[width=2.8in]{eyepieces5.eps}
\caption{The composite lens arrangements found in microscope
  objectives and eyepieces.}
\label{composite}
\end{figure}

To build a composite optical element simply place a $f$=200~mm lens and a $f$=100~mm adjacent to each other. 
What is the effective focal length of the pair? Verify that it approximates the following:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{f}=\frac{1}{f_1}+\frac{1}{f_2}
\label{eq:beamFocalLength}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Swap the $f$=100~mm lens for an $f$=-50~mm lens. Verify that the
combined focal length is shorter.

\subsection{Optics Challenge}
Arrange 4 lenses so as to form a de-magnified, real, upright
image. Hints: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Use one negative lens.
\item Space will be a problem: the lenses will take up the whole rail
  and so you will need to place the target and screen outside of the
  rail. 
\item Use the light-guide to illuminate your target to avoid it
  becoming too dim. 
\item There are multiple solutions to this problem.
\end{itemize}

\section{Illuminating the sample}
Different samples are best illuminated in different ways. In transmission
microscopy the sample is illuminated from the opposite side to which
it is imaged. In fluorescence microscopy (which you will explore later
in the course) the sample is illuminated from the same side, with the
objective serving as the condenser. It is not efficient to illuminate
the sample directly (with no intervening lenses) because light is
emitted in all directions from the source but only a narrow range of
ray angles reach the specimen. In the following two exercises you will
build two different illumination systems: critical and K\"{o}hler. The
exercises will work better if you use a laser to align the lenses
before switching to the LED for imaging the sample. 


\subsection{Critical illumination of a sample}
Critical illumination uses two lenses to focus an image of a light
source onto the specimen (Fig.~\ref{critIlum}). You will now setup
critical illumination on your lens rail. Use an LED as the light
source. Build the condenser using two lenses and place the sample at
their focal point. The lens nearer the LED is known as the
\textbf{collector lens} and the lens nearer the sample is known as the
\textbf{condenser lens}. Use the 30 mm for the collector lens and the
60 mm (convex) for the condenser lens. A suitable sample is a
coverslip with thin lines drawn on with a marker. Place the sample at
the focal point of the condenser lens. Use two more lenses to form an
image of the specimen on a piece of card. The \textbf{objective lens}
($f$=100~mm) follows the specimen, and finally the \textbf{tube lens}
($f$=300~mm) is used to form an image. Set up the lenses and image the
image the sample. What problem do you notice?

Critical illumination can be set up using either a finite or an
infinite conjugate image of the light source. A diaphragm (the
`\textbf{aperture diaphragm}') can be placed between the collector and
condenser lens, at the focal point of the second lens (the condenser
lens) to stop down the range of angles reaching the sample. This
allows the NA of the illuminant to be regulated, providing control
over the resolution, contrast, and depth of field. Add the aperture
diaphragm and observe the effect of regulating the aperture on your
sample image. Does the area illuminated alter when the diaphragm is
closed down?

\begin{figure}[h]
\center
\includegraphics[width=5in]{Critical_Illumination.eps}
\caption{A simple critical illumination set up for visual microscopy.}
\label{critIlum}
\end{figure}


\subsection{K\"{o}hler Illumination}
K\"{o}hler illumination is an important and commonly used technique in
light microscopy, as it provides even illumination of the sample
whilst ensuring the light source (e.g. the bulb filament) is not
visible. This is achieved by adding a third lens (you will use a
$f$=100) so that the image of the filament doesn't appear on the
sample but on the aperture diaphragm (which is the diaphragm located
immediately before the condenser lens). This arrangement not only
permits uniform illumination but also allows a second diaphragm to be
added. This \textbf{field diaphragm} is imaged onto the sample and so
provides a means of regulating the area of illumination. In summary,
whilst an image of the filament is still formed, it occurs at a
different plane to the image formed by the sample. Consequently, when
observing the sample the light source image is out of focus.

You will now convert the critical illumination to K\"{o}hler
illumination.  The components will be arranged in the following order:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Collector lens ($f$=30)
\item Field diaphragm
\item Field lens ($f$=100)
\item Aperture diaphragm
\item Condenser lens ($f$=60)
\item The objective and tube lenses will be as before. 
\end{enumerate}

Again, you will place the LED at one focal length before the collector
lens and the sample at the focal length of the condenser lens. The
arrangement of the components is shown in Fig.~\ref{koehler}. Verify
that you can alter the depth of field by obtaining a second coverslip
and drawing a differet target on it. Stack this alongside the original
sample and vary the sizes of the diaphragms to observe the effects.
