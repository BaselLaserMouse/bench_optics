## Basic Bench Optics


The repository contains the handout used for the TENSS basic bench exercises. The handout is written in Latex. 
IMPORTANT: Please do not push PDFs of the built handout to the repository. Instead, build the PDF, create a release, 
and add the PDF to the release. This avoids bloating the repo.
