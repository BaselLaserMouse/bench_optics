## Basic Bench Optics
The repository contains the TENSS optics practical handout. 
You can find the latest PDF of the hand-out in the project's [Releases](https://github.com/tenss/bench_optics/releases).

### Contributing
The handout is written in Latex. 
Please do not push PDFs of the built handout to the repository because it bloats the repository.
Instead, you can upload PDFs to a release.
